/**
 * Hand the webapp the bearer token it needs to call mutating endpoints.
 *
 * The token is already a localhost-scoped secret (mode 0600 in
 * ~/.signalk-updater/token) and the engine listens on a single
 * configured PublishPort (127.0.0.1 by default, or 0.0.0.0 when the
 * installer was launched with SIGNALK_LAN_EXPOSE=true). Any client
 * that has already reached the engine over that port has crossed the
 * same trust boundary the token was meant to gate. Echoing it back
 * to the SPA at boot time lets the page issue authenticated requests
 * without baking the token into static assets or relying on a
 * separate cookie-setting hop through the SignalK plugin.
